                <h1><span>Overview and Motivation</span></h1>
                <p>In today’s world, as society is getting developed people are usually stressed out from their work because of tons of reasons, including heavy workloads forcing them to work overtime, unexpected problems that they have to solve… Thus, there is an increase in the entertainment needs of people. Nowadays, people are inventing a lot of entertainment tools as well as virtual games, however, none of them are easy to play. For example, Counter Strikes, League of Legends, Battlefield all these games require so much practice and effort. Players have to spend a lot of time practicing to master all these games, not to mentioned tons of stressfulness you may have when competing with lots of people. To not only make players feel less stressful but also make them feel more relaxed I want to introduce my game project. To be more specific, that is the Tic Tac Toe game. This project aims specifically at children and people who want to reduce stressfulness after hours of working and studying hard. What makes me choose tic tac toe as my very first project of my life that related to Information Technology is that when I was a kid, tic tac toe was the first game that I played in my life. Also, tic tac toe is an easy game project people can play alone or with your friend everywhere, every time, and even every platform, because I want to make tic tac toe as the application that can be played on smartphones, and computers, especially in Android, as Its operating system remain relatively stable at 76,68% over the course of ten years starting in 2009.</p>

                <h2><span>Description</span></h2>
                <p>As tic tac toe is the easy game so It does not require the hard gameplay, people can just play the game by entering the number of the position that the developer had already name. However, this easy game has a lot of features. Firstly, the most important feature of Tic Tac Toe is Opponent Artificial Intelligence. To be more specific, this feature plays an important role in every game project, It helps the video games to be more responsive by generating many intelligent actions. Each intelligent action requires a lot of code as well as the algorithm to operate properly and precisely. So that players can play the game flexibly. For example, players can choose to play with their friends or they can choose to practice themselves with the computer. Another feature of Tic Tac Toe is sound effects, every interactive games require sound effects to make the game more interactive, and interesting. For example, if the FPS (first-person shooters) games do not have sounds effects including footsteps, gunshots,... players are not able to play effectively, and It may affect gamers’ experience. In Tic Tac Toe, funny sound effects will appear when players interact with the game: when the player wins, loses or even draws. The other most common feature would probably be interface, interface can be used to display the board, the “X”, the “O” and sometimes can be also used to send messages to players, such as the rules, the errors, and the results. For instance, if the player does not fill in the blank the computer will send a message “You can't go there. Go again”. One of the most remarkable features is the database management system. DMS is capable of storing a large amount of data which is very vital for players. Players could easily find their information thanks to Data Management System, including the results, times, places, and information that related to their opponents. Also, there is a feature that could follow gamers’ playing habits, they take information from the players and analyze that information to create a new playing habit that is suitable for their health condition. For example, if the players spending too much time staring at the screen to play the game, this feature would help the players by reminding them of the exact time they spent playing the game. Moreover, it also suggests some diseases the players may have when they spend too much time playing</p>

                <h1><span>Tools and Technologies</span></h1>
                <p>In terms of software, although in this day and age there are so many game-making tools, one of the most helpful software tools to make game is Flowlab. User could easily make a game by using Flowlab since Its operation and construction is very easy. Users could use It directly in every platform even in the browser without having a huge knowledge of programming. Flowlab allows the game creators to use built-in animation and drawing tools to make characters, NPCs, and animations. Eventually, the game creator could use Flowlab to upload their final product to iTunes for commercial purposes.</p>

                <p>To make Tic Tac Toe, you need to have some certain knowledge about how to use Python. Specifically, Tkinter is one of the most outstanding standard Python interfaces to create an interface of the Tic Tac Toe game so that players can play the game by interacting on this interface. The next thing that programmers need to know to make Tic Tac Toe is “IF, ELIF, ELSE statement”, without it the Tic Tac Toe game is not able to know whether “player 1” or “player 2” win the game. Thus, having a basic knowledge about syntax as well as “IF, ELIF, ELSE statement” is very necessary.

Firstly, by playing the Tic Tac Toe, people could easily develop their brainstorming skill, because the Tic Tac Toe is the puzzle game, thus the players have to pay a lot of concentration to play this game. As a result, players could improve their memory as well as prevent themselves from Absent-mindedness. On the other hand, the Tic Tac Toe game could also create a healthy entertainment environment, to connect players from place to place. Besides many positive aspects, there are tons of problems that need to be solved in order to let the Tic Tac Toe succeed.
