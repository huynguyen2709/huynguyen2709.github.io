							<p class="major"><b>As an entertainer, I love spending time with my friends doing things like raving and hanging out. Moreover, I have a great sense of humor, so It is very easy for me to lift up my teammates’ moods during the harsh lessons. However, in this world, no one is perfect and similarly, I have some certain positive and negative aspects:</b></p>

                            &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; Bold</strong></h2>
							<p> Entertainers aren’t known for holding back. Wanting to experience everything there is to experience, people with the Entertainer personality type don’t mind stepping out of their comfort zones when no one else is willing.<br>
                            <h2><strong>
                            &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;  Practical</strong></h2>
                            <p>To Entertainers, the world is meant to be felt and experienced. Truth is stranger than fiction, and Entertainers prefer to see and do than to wax philosophical about “what-ifs”</p>

                                <h2><strong>Observant</strong></h2>
                                    <p>With all this focus on the here and now, on doing and acting, it makes sense that Entertainers are naturals when it comes to noticing real, tangible things and changes.</p>
                                    <h2><strong>
                                                               Excellent People Skills</strong></h2>
                                    <p>   More so than things though, Entertainers love to pay attention to people. They are talkative, witty, and almost never run out of things to discuss. For people with this personality type, happiness and satisfaction stem from the time they spend with the people they enjoy being with.</p>

                            &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Sensitive</strong></h2>
                            <p>Entertainers (especially Turbulent ones) are strongly emotional, and very vulnerable to criticism – they can feel like they’ve been backed into a corner, sometimes reacting badly. This is probably Entertainers’ greatest weakness, because it makes it so hard to address any other weaknesses brought to light.<br>
                            <h2><strong>
                            &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Conflict-Averse</strong></h2>
                            <p>Entertainers sometimes ignore and avoid conflict entirely. They tend to say and do what’s needed to get out of such situations, then move on to something more fun.</p>

                                <h2><strong>Poor Long-Term Planners</strong></h2>
                                <p>In fact, Entertainer personalities rarely make detailed plans for the future. To them, things come as they come, and they rarely bother with taking the time to lay out steps and consequences, with the belief that they could change at any moment – even with things that can be planned.</p>
                                <h2><strong>
                                                           Unfocused</strong></h2>
                                <p>Anything that requires long-term dedication and focus is a particular challenge for Entertainers. In academics, dense, unchanging subjects like Classic Literature are much more difficult than more dynamic, relatable subjects like psychology. The trick for Entertainers is to find day-to-day joy in broader goals, and to tough it out with those tedious things that must be done.</p>
